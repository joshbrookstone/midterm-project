# Midterm Project

## Schedule: 

* 9am PST meetings

## User Stories: 

1. As a user I want to see all the stories on my homepage along with their status because I want a dashboard.

1. As an authorized user, I want to be able to start a story, because I want to create the best story ever.

1. As a user, I want to see the upvotes of a contribution so I can decide what to add to my story.

1. As the creator of a story I want to control what gets added to my story because it's mine!

1. As a creator of a story, I want to mark the story complete, so that no more contributions are made and it is ready to be read.

1. As an user, I want to contribute to stories because I have awesome ideas.

1. As a user, I want to be able to upvote contributions, because only the best contributions should be added to the story.

1. As a user I shouldn't be able to edit any one elses stories because they aren't mine.

1. As a user, I want to be able to read a story, because I want to be entertained.
